# Usage
- Set your ED journal directory in directory.txt
- Run the game and wait for it to load, then run run.bat
- Hit enter after finishing FSSS to get a list of planets with bio signals
- Hit enter again after scanning a planet to get a list of possible species and their expected values
- Type "end" or hit ctrl+c to close when you're finished

Let me know on Discord at mck#9061 if you find a planet with a species that isn't listed.
