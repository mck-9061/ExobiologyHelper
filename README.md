# Usage
- Set your ED journal directory in directory.txt
- Run the game and wait for it to load, then run run.bat
- Hit enter after finishing FSSS to get a list of planets with bio signals
- Hit enter again after scanning a planet to get a list of possible species and their expected values
- Type "end" or hit ctrl+c to close when you're finished

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you find a planet with a species that isn't listed.

# Example
- After FSSSing all the planets in the system, planets with bio signs are displayed:<br>

- After DSSing a planet, the possible species are displayed:<br>

- This planet appears likely to have a high-value Tubus species, so it's worth visiting (if it hadn't already been discovered).
